## CodeTheDream - 04/11/2024 Group Session Example Project

This repository contains a data table component that we will be using to practice handling asynchronous requests, conditional rendering, and the useReducer hook. We'll be working on this during the group mentorship session to understand why and how to use each concept.

You should clone this repo and start working from the `master` branch, which only has a low-functional HTML template and none of the cool stuff yet. If you want to see the final result, check out the `completed-example` branch.
